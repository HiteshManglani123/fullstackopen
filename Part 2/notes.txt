Notes part 2
What's the difference between an experienced JavaScript programmer and a rookie? 
The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.

console.log('props value is', props)

Important functions for arrays:

High-order-functions (filter and reject)
Map
Reduce

Each element generated by the map method, must each have a unique key value

^Reason: React uses the key attribute of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered
